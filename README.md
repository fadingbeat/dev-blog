## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Add a New Blog Post

Adding a new post is straightforward:

1.  **Navigate to the `content/blog/` directory:**
    `dev-blog/content/blog/`

2.  **Create a new Markdown file (`.md`):**

    - Name your file using hyphens and lowercase letters (e.g., `my-new-awesome-article.md`). This filename will become the URL slug for your post.

3.  **Add YAML Front Matter and Markdown content:**
    Each post must start with YAML front matter (metadata) enclosed by `---` lines, followed by your Markdown content.

    tags: [nextjs, blog, new-features] # Optional array of tags
    ---

    ## Introduction to Your New Post

    This is where the main content of your blog post begins. You can use standard Markdown syntax here.

    ### Subheadings

    - Lists are easy.
    - Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

    ```javascript
    // Example JavaScript code
    console.log('Hello, World!');
    ```
    ````

    You can also embed images:
    ![Image Alt Text](https://example.com/your-image.jpg)

    And links:
    [Visit Google](https://www.google.com)

    ```

    ```

4.  **Save the file.** The development server will automatically detect the new post and rebuild.

## üåê Deployment

This application is designed to be easily deployable to platforms like Vercel (recommended for Next.js applications).

1.  **Commit your changes** and push them to your Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  **Connect your repository** to Vercel (or your preferred hosting provider).
3.  Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js project and deploy it.
4.  For a blog, consider setting up a subdomain (e.g., `blog.nikolina.dev`) for the deployed application.
